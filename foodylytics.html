			<p> Foodylytics is the product of a group project for the class Cogs187A (Usability and Information Architecture), at UCSD. Foodylytics is an app design project with a target market of the elderly with the premise of promoting health; a requirement for the project. Thus Foodylytics was created, an app that informs and tracks users of the food intake, be it calories, sodium, etc. Along with recommending healthy delicious alternatives to the users. </p>

			<h2> Foodylytics Creation </h2>
		</div>
		<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-2-24">  </div>
		<div class="pure-u-1 pure-u-md-11-24">
			<p> Before the creation of Foodylytics, we needed to have a better understanding of our target market. Through research and interviews we created a variety of issues and eventually wanted something to do with improving everyday health, and focused on working with food as it is something required to be healthy.  </p>
            <div class="content-pill">
				<p> The premise is that as people grow older, many start to have dietary restrictions, which limits what they can eat. Foodylytics helps by recommending a variety of healthy options that they might not have heard of, based on the restrictions the user has imputed. Along with recommendations the app also tracks food intake and will also recommend based on what the user has already taken. </p>

			<p> I was the team leader of this group project. As the team leader, I distribute roles to my other two members, along with making an implementation plan to keep up with deadlines. I also created storyboards, wireframes, and prototypes to keep up with the ideas of the group. Unfortunately one of our group members dropped the class, thus I had to redistribute roles between two students. I took up most of the back end work, implementing user inputs and processing these inputs to results, and some front-end work, while my partner dealt with most of the front-end and design work. I also conduct user-testing, reviewing these tests to make improvements and make the call to make changes; skipping or changing an implementation to keep up with deadlines. </p>

				<p> In this storyboard, there is an elderly that has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. As such the doctor recommends that they should avoid eating certain types of food. Later at a party, the elderly don't know what food they can eat that is available for them at the party. Someone recommended them to Foodlytics and through the app, they now know what food to avoid at the party. </p>

				<p> For this scenario, there is an elderly man who received news about a disease causing him to have a strict diet. Because of his strict diet, he has been eating the same food everyday to be safe, but is getting bored and tired of eating the same thing. He finds out about Foodylytics, uses the app and learns about different cuisines that he could safely eat. How he has a lot of different options and now has a variety of food to pick from.  </p>

			<div class="label"></div>
			<p> After receiving feedback from initial testing, we made some changes for high fidelity prototypes. We decided on continuing to use paper prototypes as it was easier to conduct testing, which we conducted a Wizard of Oz experiment testing, testing how users would interact and react to the flow of the app. </p>

			<!-- <p> Another feature we knew that would provide value was an area to provide relevant content based on analytics. We allowed users to toggle the display of these takeaways because it’s a reflection of the analytics below, and we felt that while it was valuable, it takes up a lot of vertical real estate for “redundant” information.</p>
			<div class="label"> </div>
			<p> Another key feature was rich notifications. </p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twine_hifi2.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> We wanted to provide CPOs/Heads of HR a feed of event-based notifications offering a quick view into the most salient day to day events occurring in their org. Initially, we decided to only build notifications for new hires and terminations. If the feature is validated, we’ll branch out to events like upcoming performance reviews, slowdowns in the recruiting pipeline, or impending cliff dates for equity grants. If they select “See all notifications”, they’re taken to a separate page where they can view a full time-based list of recent events. </p>
			<div class="label"> </div>
			<p> Another core feature of Twine is an ultra-comprehensive profile of employees. The overview tab houses a host of information pulled from a variety of existing HR platforms. While the design is somewhat simple and straightforward, it was imperative to design with scalability in mind as some fields may be missing information, depending on the existing HR software that companies already use. </p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twine_hifi3.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> Under the timeline tab, CPO’s/Heads of HR can see a robust timeline of categorized events from the day that the employee started to present day.</p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twine_hifi4.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> Finally, the ‘Stats’ tab is really where the Twine secret sauce lives. CPO’s/Heads of HR can compare employees to their counterparts amongst a variety of comparison groups. The interactions surrounding this tool are quite complex, with lots of minute design decisions involved, so we decided to integrate the Joyride plugin to provide contextual onboarding via tooltips that walks new users step by step of how the tool works.</p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twin_hifi5.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> To create a comparison group, users simply select the “+ add filters” button, which slides out a side panel with a variety of dropdown selections to choose from.</p>
