                Foodylytics is the product of a group project for the class Cogs187A; Usability and Information Architecture, at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). This class is about the development of good web and software application design. Developing the ability to create something that is usable and effective to any target market.

                Before the creation of Foodylytics, we had to understand our target market, and the problems they face before deciding on a solution. After listing out various issues, we narrowed it down to focusing on improving everyday health. With this in mind we decided to create Foodylytics, which is a food recommendation application. The premise behind it was that as people get holder, many start to have dietary restrictions, thus limiting their options on what to eat. How Foodylytics can solve this is by recommending a variety of different plate options based on the restriction that the user set, which usually is their dietary restriction. With the product in mind we start the creation process. The first step was to establish the storyboard; scenarios where our idea would help solve the problem.

                Storyboard 1: Here are two examples of how our app can be effective in solving these two scenario. In the first scenario there is a woman who has just been diagnose with high blood pressure with the doctor recommending that she should avoid eating certain types of food. While at a party she doesn’t know what food she can eat. Someone recommends her Foodyltics and through using the app, she now knows what food to avoid.

                We used various design skills during the creation for this project. Some of which included

                Establishing Point of Views
                Creating Inspiration and Storyboards
                Prototyping
                Lo-fi and Hi-fi Prototypes
                Mock-Ups using Sketch and InVision
                Conduct User Testing and Feedback
                Using these various design methods we were able to design a phone application that promotes a healthy fun lifestyle for the elderly.

                Prototypes is important for the creation of a product. It helps us see how our application will look, its workflow, and how users might interact with the design. This allows us to make quick changes if necessary, helping to create a better product.

                LOW-FIDELITY (LO-FI) PROTOTYPES: 
                We first start out with Lo-Fi (paper) Prototypes, giving us a quick and easy model of how our application had looked. First we created an outline of the work flow, step by step pages of the general steps a user would take when using the app. Then we drew a paper prototype of each of the main pages of the app for a general design of the app.

            <p>
                HIGH-FIDELITY (HI-FI) PROTOTYPES
                After feedback from the lo-fi prototypes, we made changes to for a high fidelity prototype that was ready to be used for user testing and feedback. We decided on using a paper prototype for our high fidelity prototype as it was easier for testing, which we conducted a Wizard of Oz experiment testing, so that we could see how the user would interact and react to the flow of the app.
