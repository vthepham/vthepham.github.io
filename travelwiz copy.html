			<p> TravelWiz is the creation of a course long group project thought up by two partners in a COGS 120 (Interaction Design) class at UCSD. The project was to create a Web Application, using JavaScript, partially Node.js, and was launched using Heroku. There is a project focus based on the section we were assigned to, that being to create an app with a focus on Presenting Information. What we decided to create is a scheduling app specifically to help when planning a vacation. This is done by what information is presented to the user. </p>

Unfortunately one of our group members dropped the class, thus I had to redistribute roles between two students.

			<p> Vacation is the time to relax. The time to enjoy yourself, and let your worries fade away. While vacationing is relaxing, unfortunately planning for a vacation can be a tiring and stressful process. Along with booking flight, lodging, and figuring out modes of travel. You also have to figure out how you want to spend your trip, what activities you want to do, what to eat, etc. Figuring out what activities to do can be difficult as people tend to focus on one type, like sightseeing, and sometimes forget about other activities; visiting local cuisines, tours, etc. Missing out or skipping on these activities may lessen an enjoyable experience. </p>

			<p> Below are various paper prototypes and wireframes designs. We first started with paper prototypes for quick user research and testing, examining how users interact with various functions of the app.  </p>
			<p> Since the focus of the section is a focus of presenting information. Things that were focused on is how to give users important information quickly. Some things that were done is creating sections for specific activities. As for the descriptions, we believe that a quick summary of the activity and average hour and prices is important for travelers and help in making a decision. </p>

			<p> After the main function and app was mostly completed. It was ready for research through user testing and feedback. Testing was conducted using an A/B testing method; having users try a version of the app that has various changes between each other. Testing was done through in-person, chosen with convenience sampling. During testing we observe how users interact with the app, identify user breakdowns. After testing, we conduct an interview for feedback, to see what was good, how to improve user breakdowns to further make improvements to the app. </p>
			<img src="images/travelwiz/travtest1.jpg" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px; max-width: 350px; max-height: 350px;">
			<img src="images/travelwiz/travtest2.jpg" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px; max-width: 350px; max-height: 350px;">
			<div class="label"></div>
			<p> From feedback, we made some changes that we believe improved the overall app experience. Some of these changes include a way for users to go back to the top of the page quickly (without scrolling). Thus we added an arrow button at the side of the screen to instantly bring the users to the top of the page when clicked. Another change was making the submit button static at the bottom of the screen rather than the end of the page. This gave users a quicker way to access the schedule page (rather than needing to scroll). One of the bigger changes is to the schedule page. It originally would list the activities of the user, the changes now include activities being color coded based on the activities group/identity, for example eating being purple, sightseeing being blue, etc. This gives users instant feedback on their schedule. </p>
			<!-- <p> Another feature we knew that would provide value was an area to provide relevant content based on analytics. We allowed users to toggle the display of these takeaways because it’s a reflection of the analytics below, and we felt that while it was valuable, it takes up a lot of vertical real estate for “redundant” information.</p>
			<div class="label"> </div>
			<p> Another key feature was rich notifications. </p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twine_hifi2.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> We wanted to provide CPOs/Heads of HR a feed of event-based notifications offering a quick view into the most salient day to day events occurring in their org. Initially, we decided to only build notifications for new hires and terminations. If the feature is validated, we’ll branch out to events like upcoming performance reviews, slowdowns in the recruiting pipeline, or impending cliff dates for equity grants. If they select “See all notifications”, they’re taken to a separate page where they can view a full time-based list of recent events. </p>
			<div class="label"> </div>
			<p> Another core feature of Twine is an ultra-comprehensive profile of employees. The overview tab houses a host of information pulled from a variety of existing HR platforms. While the design is somewhat simple and straightforward, it was imperative to design with scalability in mind as some fields may be missing information, depending on the existing HR software that companies already use. </p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twine_hifi3.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> Under the timeline tab, CPO’s/Heads of HR can see a robust timeline of categorized events from the day that the employee started to present day.</p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twine_hifi4.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> Finally, the ‘Stats’ tab is really where the Twine secret sauce lives. CPO’s/Heads of HR can compare employees to their counterparts amongst a variety of comparison groups. The interactions surrounding this tool are quite complex, with lots of minute design decisions involved, so we decided to integrate the Joyride plugin to provide contextual onboarding via tooltips that walks new users step by step of how the tool works.</p>
			<img src="assets/twine/twin_hifi5.png" class="asset" style="margin-top: 25px;">
			<p> To create a comparison group, users simply select the “+ add filters” button, which slides out a side panel with a variety of dropdown selections to choose from.</p>

			<p> There were some things that were planned but didn’t make it into the final product due to lack of time or inability to create such a task, especially with only two people. One main thing I wanted to do was to redesign the scheduling page, where the user can see their schedule for the day in a more calendar format; having the hours listed from top to bottom on the left (ex. 8AM, 9AM etc.), then a vertical box to cover the timeframes for those hours, allowing more visuals for users to see the length of a particular activity for the day. Another thing I wanted to fix was that the schedule wasn’t able to sustain its information; the information deletes itself after leaving the page. If given more time I believe that we would be able to fix this issue. Also another thing is that we didn’t allow the users to make comments on the schedule page.  </p>
			<!-- <img src="assets/twine/logos.png" class="food-logos" style="margin-top: 50px;">
			<p> With Twine’s growth, they hired a a full-time product designer based out of New York, so we have since parted ways. I look forward to seeing much more of Twine in the future! </p> -->
